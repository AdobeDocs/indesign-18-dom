# What is the OMV file?

The “Object Model Viewer” will be familiar to users of [ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ExtendScript-Toolkit). As of InDesign 18.0, ESTK no longer reliably connects to InDesign, so we have provided the OMV references here.
